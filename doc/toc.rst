Project Report
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You should prepare a project report, using a word processor. The report should
primarily document the work done. It should contain two parts.

1. A main part, explaining the problem and your solution. About the size of an
   IEEE transactions paper (i.e. maximum 10 pages in two columns and 11 point
   font).
   A. What is the problem you had to solve ? why it is a problem ? why would any
      one care about solving it ?
   B. Describe your solution. Explain the main features, the ones you believe
      are most valuable.
   C. List your achievements, give their nature, quality and quantity.
      Distinguish your contribution from what others did before. For example: I
      designed an ns model of the VP-TFMCC protocol, 2500 lines of simple code,
      300 lines of high value code. Debugging took 2 weeks.
   D. What skills did you exercise, what skills did you have to acquire for the
      project
   E. Report on the major events of the project, including unexpected
      difficulties.
   F. Provide a self-assessment (where did you succeed most, where did you fail)

2. An appendix with supporting material:
   A. Give the background information that is needed to understand and
      appreciate your work.
   B. Give only this background information (your report is a project
      achievement report; it should explain very clearly what you did, but does
      not have to be a tutorial on a general topic.)
   C. Details of source code, simulation results, measurement campaigns.
   D. Details about project events.

Goal: provide information
This document will discuss the various methods that can be used in a game
engine to render water in real time.

.. Focus on one type of game: real time strategy. Also outline vision for
   bachelor thesis

Implicit purpose
----------------

- Establish a relastionship
- Create trust en establish credibility
- Document actions

Statement of Objective
----------------------

State the document's objective at the beginning


Problem statement
=================

Problem statements often have three elements:

1. the problem itself, stated clearly and with enough contextual detail to
   establish why it is important;
2. the method of solving the problem, often stated as a claim or a working
   thesis;
3. the purpose, statement of objective and scope of the document the writer is
   preparing.

These elements should be brief so that the reader does not get lost.

.. Bird's eye view?

Real-time water rendering for large masses of water observed at aerial view.


Audience
========

Audience type: experts

- If your audience includes general experts, provide sufficient background
  information and define any terms that they might be unfamiliar with.
- Do not just present a concept to an expert. Also explain its parts and
  processes in detail.

Forecasting
===========

Present the whole before the parts. One of the common problems in reading
science and engineering materials is that of trying to understand the context of
the discussion. Give your reader a general view of where you are going before
you plunge into the details. This principle applies to the introductions of
documents, as well as to the openings of document sections.

Drafting a Technical Document
=============================

- Writing can generate new ideas. If you discover potentially relevant new ideas
  or approaches, include them even if they are not in your outline. You can
  revise your outline when you edit for organization.
- The main purpose of a first draft is to sketch out ideas in writing.
  Consequently, fixing specific problems in sentences, words, grammar, spelling,
  usage, or mechanics when writing a first draft can be distracting and can
  hinder the development of important and interesting ideas. Many writers just
  mark these problems when writing a first draft and then address them when they
  edit for grammar, style, and usage.
- You may find yourself needing to locate or develop additional data or to
  confirm already exisiting data. Marginal notes or comments in the text (e.g.,
  "add median response time," "need figures," or "check maximum values") allow
  you to keep your ideas flowing.
- You do not need to write the document in the order of your outline. Many
  writers, for example, find it useful to write the introduction and the
  conclusion of a document last.
