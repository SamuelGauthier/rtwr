\section{The Simple Gerstner Wave Approach}\label{sec:simple_gerstner_waves}

% In the simple gerstner wave approach talk on how I build the application
% because SLProject wasn't compiling and say also that 0 A.D. was an overkill to
% start with. Talk about the LSD MDMA strange effects, talk about the parameters
% that have to be shit out of the ass. Talk about the Shading method used. Also
% mention that 16 weeks ago you didn't know anything and that's why you choose
% to implement the gerstner approach.

We opted to implement the Gerstner Wave approach from \autoref{subsub:gerstner}
because it was the easiest to understand for someone new to graphic pipeline
programming and well described in \autocite{fernando2004gpu}. 

We integrated it into a demonstration application coded in C++ using the
\textit{GLEW}, \textit{GLFW} and \textit{stb} libraries.  C++ was used because
both applications in \autoref{subsec:candidate_apps} are programmed with it. We
use GLEW because it is a cross-platform library to load the OpenGL extensions.
GLFW is used for the window creation and keyboard interactions. Finally we
utilize the simple but powerful capabilities of stb to read and load images into
memory.

First we setup all the windowing
