\section{The Simple Gerstner Wave Approach}\label{sec:simple_gerstner_waves}

% In the simple gerstner wave approach talk on how I build the application
% because SLProject wasn't compiling and say also that 0 A.D. was an overkill to
% start with. Talk about the LSD MDMA strange effects, talk about the parameters
% that have to be shit out of the ass. Talk about the Shading method used. Also
% mention that 16 weeks ago you didn't know anything and that's why you choose
% to implement the gerstner approach.
