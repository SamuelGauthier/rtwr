% Failed attempt, in future use projected grid as in many productions,
% integrating in 0 a.d. will be difficult because rendering time is unknown,
% targeted devices may not support it? Say that the reflection method used is
% not good, only works for the skybox.
% In the discussion talk about the bad frame rate, the visual unpleasantness and
% the better thing to do, that is projected grid and other method. Also tell
% that's what you will use in the bachelor thesis and give the relevant
% literature with it.
